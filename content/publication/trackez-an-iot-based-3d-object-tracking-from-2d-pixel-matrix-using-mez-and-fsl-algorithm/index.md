summary: "The imaging devices sense light reflected from objects and reconstruct
  images using the 2D-sensor matrix. It is a 2D Cartesian coordinate system
  where the depth dimension is absent. The absence of a depth axis on 2D images
  imposes challenges in locating and tracking objects in a 3D environment.
  Real-time object tracking faces another challenge imposed by network latency.
  This paper presents the development and analysis of a real-time, real-world
  object tracker called Trackez, which is capable of tracking within the top
  hemisphere. It uses Machine Vision at the IoT Edge (Mez) technology to
  mitigate latency sensitivity. A novel algorithm, Follow-Satisfy-Loop (FSL),
  has been developed and implemented in this paper that optimally tracks the
  target. It does not require the depth-axis. The simple and innovative design
  and incorporation of Mez technology have made the proposed object tracker a
  latency "
